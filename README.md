IMPROVEMENTS FROM ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT:

It randomly generates a CCV and a card number for each individual user. A user can make the decision to either sign in with their username or with their ID document. We also changed the name of the branches for creative flair, so instead of having the aaa, madrid and segovia branches we have the colombia, venezuela and madrid branches. We used pointers to access the different branches.
