Our improvements to the program:
It randomly generates a CCV and a card number for each individual user. The user can also decide whether they would like to login with either their username or the DNI/Passport. We also changed the name of the branches for creative flair, so instead of having the aaa, madrid and segovia branches we have the colombia, venezuela and madrid branches. We used pointers to access the different branches. 
Most of the requirements listed in the 'Final Requirements  Part II' powerpoint are implemented; we took the liberty of blocking/unblocking a user's card to be our equivalent of blacklisting a user since a user can only have one card at a time. 
The only requirements missing are the interest rate and a limit for negative positions since there have to be users initialized with a negative balance. There is also not an individual array that counts a bank's total balance, but the numbers add up to the amounts specified in the powerpoint. The program does specify the last time a user logged in, and if they have not logged into the system then the time at which the account was initialized is considered as their most recent login.
